Minimint is an experimental implementation of a federated chaumian mint.
It is still under heavy development and not open source yet.
Currently only depositing, withdrawing and sending mint-internal payments works.
Implementing a Lightning network integration will be the next step.

The asciinema recording is rather wide, so if you have a small screen it might not show the entire recorded area.
We recommend to watch it in full screen mode.
