[{"id":0,"href":"/","title":"","parent":"","content":"Welcome to FediMint.org    This site is intended to collect research and ideas about federated chaumian mints (or federated chaumian banks, but nobody likes banks) to scale Bitcoin while also making it more private.\nChaumian Mints    One of the (if not the) earliest e-cash schemes were Chaumian mints or banks. They use blind signatures to allow the anonymous transfer of backing assets held by the mint. The basic idea is that a user can give the mint some amount x of an asset and the mint in turn blind signs x IOUs that allow the user to either withdraw the asset or exchange them for new IOUs or products. The small word \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; does the heavy lifting here, it means that the user and mint run a cryptographic protocol that allows the user to acquire a digital signature on some data without the mint learning anything about the message or the signature so that when the mint sees one of its signatures for some message it can no longer tell to whom it was issued. This means trading these IOUs is completely anonymous.\n\u0026ldquo;Why have I never heard of this before?\u0026rdquo; you may ask and the sad answer is that it never really caught on. One big problem of chaumian mints is that they are a single point of failure and an easy target for regulation and other attacks. Most countries financial regulations disallow anonymous payments to some degree, so running a mint in the open is a bad idea. Running one anonymously brings with it the problem of trust, the operator could run away with the money at any point. This combination of problems relegated the concept to a very small, low value market, e.g. to pay for watchtower fees in lightning.\nWhat is a Federated Mint?    In a federated mint the required trust is split over multiple parties. It employs a consensus algorithm and threshold cryptography to guarantee both safety and availability even in the case that some parties are compromised. That means if the participants are sufficiently distributed not even a nation state level attacker can harm the federation. Running it anonymously also becomes much more attractive since there is no single party anymore that could run away with the backing funds.\nHow does it relate to Bitcoin    Bitcoin is the first asset in human history that can truly be held in a federated manner, meaning only being accessible if a certain quorum of people agrees. It is thus the perfect backing asset for a federated mint. A first, primitive version could work as follows:\n depostit: A User sends BTC to the federation\u0026rsquo;s wallet and in turn receives the corresponding amount of tokens. transfer: The user can then pay someone else using these tokens, which works as follows:  The payer selects appropriately many tokens and sends them to the payee The payee exchanges these tokens for new ones using the federated mint Only then the payee accepts the transaction, as the exchange may fail in case of a double spend   withdraw: Finally any user can redeem BTC for tokens again.  We see that between peg-in and peg-outs there can be many internal transactions, so federated mints do not only provide excellent privacy nut also scaling. One problem with this primitive version is the enormous centralization pressure it exerts, as two federated mints won\u0026rsquo;t accept each other\u0026rsquo;s tokens, making big mints more attractive. This can be mitigated by integrating with Lightning. For this the federation needs to support two more operations:\n ln-send: pay an LN invoice using tokens. ln-receive: issue an invoice to a user. Once it is payed the user receives the appropriate amount of tokens.  With these two operations any federated mint suddenly becomes interoperable with any other Lightning node, including other federated mints. The federation essentially becomes a hosted but federated Lightning wallet.\nWhat about centralization    Yes, a federated mint requires more trust than a self-hosted Lighning node or on-chain Bitcoin. But we think that the risk can be minimized sufficiently by distributing the federation members. There are many people that can not or do not want to run their own lightning wallet, be it because of fees or maintenance effort. For these a federated mint is much preferable to centralized solutions as it protects user privacy and has no single points of failure. Systemic risks should be sufficiently mitigated by the fact that any willing group of people should be able to start their own federation.\nExisting projects    We are currently aware of two efforts to build such a federated mint:\n SCRIT: A half-finished implementation of a federated chaumian mint written in Go, developed by Frank Braun and Jonathan Logan. To our knowledge it does not support BTC backing (yet?), but was the first public implementation. You can read more on Jonathan\u0026rsquo;s blog. MiniMint: A (for now) private prototype still under heavy development written in Rust. It already supports rudimentary BTC backing but no Lighning integration and is generally not considered stable enough yet. If you are interested pelase reach out to elsirion.
